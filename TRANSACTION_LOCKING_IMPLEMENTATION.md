# Transaction Locking Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the critical transaction locking feature implemented to prevent duplicate order fulfillment.

## Problem Solved
**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Payment codes (tx_id) were being reused even after orders were FULFILLED, causing:
- Duplicate product fulfillment
- Financial losses
- Inventory discrepancies

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Custom Exceptions (`utils/exceptions.py`)
Created custom exception classes for better error handling:
- **TransactionLockedException**: Raised when attempting to modify locked transactions
- **InvalidStatusTransitionError**: Raised for invalid status changes
- **InsufficientAmountError**: Raised when trying to use more than available
- **DuplicateTransactionError**: Raised for duplicate transaction attempts
- **GatewayNotFoundError**: Raised when gateway is not found

### 2. Transaction Model Enhancements (`payments/models.py`)

#### New Properties:
- **`remaining_amount`**: Calculated property that returns `amount_expected - amount_paid`
- **`is_locked`**: Returns `True` for FULFILLED or CANCELLED transactions

#### New Methods:
- **`can_transition_to(new_status)`**: Validates if a status transition is allowed
- **`clean()`**: Model-level validation that:
  - Prevents `amount_paid` from exceeding `amount_expected`
  - Blocks modifications to locked transactions
  - Enforces valid status transitions
- **`save()`**: Override that implements:
  - Auto-fulfill when `amount_paid >= amount_expected`
  - Auto-mark as PARTIALLY_FULFILLED when partially paid
  - Automatic validation via `full_clean()`

### 3. Valid Status Transitions
```
NOT_PROCESSED → PROCESSING, CANCELLED
PROCESSING → PARTIALLY_FULFILLED, FULFILLED, CANCELLED
PARTIALLY_FULFILLED → FULFILLED, CANCELLED
FULFILLED → (LOCKED - no transitions)
CANCELLED → (LOCKED - no transitions)
```

### 4. Serializer Updates (`payments/serializers.py`)
Enhanced `TransactionSerializer` to expose:
- `remaining_amount` (read-only)
- `is_locked` (read-only)
- Additional fields: `amount_expected`, `amount_paid`, `notes`, `gateway_type`, etc.

### 5. Comprehensive Tests (`payments/tests/test_transaction_locking.py`)
Created 15 test cases covering:
- Remaining amount calculation
- Locking behavior for all statuses
- Prevent modification of FULFILLED/CANCELLED transactions
- Auto-fulfill when fully paid
- Auto-partial-fulfill when partially paid
- Amount validation (can't exceed expected)
- Valid and invalid status transitions
- Cancellation at any unlocked stage

## Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Full Payment
```python
# Customer pays Ksh 5,000
transaction.amount_expected = 5000.00
transaction.amount_paid = 5000.00
transaction.save()

# Auto-locks
assert transaction.status == 'FULFILLED'
assert transaction.is_locked == True
assert transaction.remaining_amount == 0

# Cannot modify
transaction.status = 'PROCESSING'  # Raises ValidationError
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Payment
```python
# Customer pays Ksh 5,000
transaction.amount_expected = 5000.00
transaction.status = 'PROCESSING'

# Staff uses Ksh 3,000 for Order A
transaction.amount_paid = 3000.00
transaction.save()

# Auto-marks as PARTIALLY_FULFILLED
assert transaction.status == 'PARTIALLY_FULFILLED'
assert transaction.remaining_amount == 2000.00
assert transaction.is_locked == False  # Still unlocked

# Staff uses remaining Ksh 2,000 for Order B
transaction.amount_paid = 5000.00
transaction.save()

# Auto-locks
assert transaction.status == 'FULFILLED'
assert transaction.is_locked == True
```

### Scenario 3: Attempting to Reuse FULFILLED Transaction
```python
# Transaction is FULFILLED
transaction.status = 'FULFILLED'
transaction.save()

# Later, staff tries to change status
transaction.status = 'PROCESSING'
transaction.save()  # Raises ValidationError: "Transaction is FULFILLED and cannot be modified"
```

## API Impact

### GET /api/v1/transactions/
Response now includes:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "tx_id": "QWERTY1234",
  "amount": 5000.00,
  "amount_expected": 5000.00,
  "amount_paid": 3000.00,
  "remaining_amount": 2000.00,
  "is_locked": false,
  "status": "PARTIALLY_FULFILLED",
  "notes": "",
  ...
}
```

### PATCH /api/v1/transactions/{id}/
Attempting to modify a locked transaction returns:
```json
{
  "status": ["Transaction is FULFILLED and cannot be modified"]
}
```

## Frontend Implications

### Transaction Card UI (Recommended)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ QWERTY1234 - Ksh 5,000         │
│ Status: FULFILLED 🔒 LOCKED     │
│ Remaining: Ksh 0                │
│ [Cannot Modify]                 │ ← Disabled
└─────────────────────────────────┘

vs

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ASDFG5678 - Ksh 5,000          │
│ Status: PARTIALLY_FULFILLED     │
│ Used: Ksh 3,000                 │
│ Remaining: Ksh 2,000            │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Files Modified
1. **Created**:
   - `utils/__init__.py`
   - `utils/exceptions.py`
   - `payments/tests/test_transaction_locking.py`

2. **Modified**:
   - `payments/models.py` - Added locking logic
   - `payments/serializers.py` - Exposed new fields
   - `management/settings.py` - Added `django_filters` to INSTALLED_APPS

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these changes
2. Update frontend to:
   - Show lock status (icon/badge)
   - Disable edit buttons for locked transactions
   - Display `remaining_amount` prominently
3. Train staff on partial fulfillment workflow
4. Monitor for any ValidationError exceptions in logs

## Benefits
✅ Prevents duplicate order fulfillment
✅ Protects against financial losses
✅ Enforces proper workflow
✅ Maintains data integrity
✅ Provides clear audit trail
✅ Enables partial payment handling
